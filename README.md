# jmws_idmygadget_for_joomla
A single version of the idMyGadget adapter API that I want to integrate with the default joomla templates Beez3 and protostar.

## History
Copied this code from https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget and made a few changes (mostly just deleted the unneeded demo stuff) for use with joomla.

See the parent project, [idMyGadget](https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget) for background information.

### Device Detection in Action
To see idMyGadget in operation, see
[my resume](https://github.com/tomwhartung/resume) ,
which is online here: http://tomwhartung.com/resume ,
For the full effect, be sure to visit 
http://tomwhartung.com/resume
on both your phone and a desktop or tablet!

## Plan

My plans are fuzzy now, so documentation would be premature.

### idMyGadget
Regarding idMyGadget, the plan is to not make any changes to the parent project,
so we can do whatever we want for joomla here,
with out having to worry about messing up projects depended on idMyGadget,
such as my [resume](https://github.com/tomwhartung/resume) .

### jmws_idmygadget_for_joomla
The idea for this project is: to integrate the device detection offered by [idMyGadget](https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget)
into the default joomla templates Beez3 and protostar, which I have copied into these repos:

* https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_beez3_idmygadget and
* https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_protostar_idMyGadget

There's a strong possibility I will add in jQuery Mobile for phones,
as I did for my
[resume](https://github.com/tomwhartung/resume) ,
because it is kind of cool.

## Conclusion

That's about all I have to say for now, because plans are fuzzy and the future is unpredictable!

# jmws_idmygadget_for_joomla
A single version of the idMyGadget adapter API that I want to integrate with the default joomla templates Beez3 and protostar.

# History
Copied this code from [https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget] and made a few changes (mostly deletions) for use with joomla.

See the parent project, [idMyGadget](https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget) for background information.

# Plan

My plans are fuzzy now, so documentation would be premature.

The idea is to integrate the device detection offered by [idMyGadget](https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget)
into the default joomla templates Beez3 and protostar, which I have copied into these repos:

* https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_beez3_idmygadget and
* https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_protostar_idMyGadget

There's a strong possibility I will add in jQuery Mobile for phones, (as I did for my [resume](https://github.com/tomwhartung/resume) .

# Conclusion

That's about all I have to say for now, because plans are fuzzy and the future is unpredictable!
